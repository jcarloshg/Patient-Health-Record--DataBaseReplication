**Actor:** Healthcare Provider (Doctor, Nurse, Administrator)

**Description:** Create a new electronic health record for a patient in the system.

**Preconditions:**

- Patient does not already exist in the system

**Main Flow:**

1. User enters patient demographic information (name, DOB, ID, contact details)
2. User enters initial medical information (allergies, medical history, current medications)
3. System validates the input data
4. System creates the record in the primary database
5. System replicates the record to master-slave replicas for high availability
6. System asynchronously replicates to DR replica in geographically separated region
7. System confirms successful creation and returns patient ID

**Postconditions:**

- New patient record exists in primary database
- Record is replicated to all configured replicas
- Audit log entry is created

**Exception Flow:**

- If validation fails, system displays error messages
- If replication to primary replica fails, system alerts administrators
- If DR replication fails, system logs the issue but allows creation to proceed
