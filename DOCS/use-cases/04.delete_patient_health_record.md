**Preconditions:**

3. User confirms deletion with reason/justification
4. System performs soft delete (marks as inactive) rather than physical deletion
5. System replicates deletion status to all replicas

7. System confirms successful deletion/archival

**Postconditions:**

- Record is marked as deleted/archived in primary database
- Deletion status is replicated to all replicas
